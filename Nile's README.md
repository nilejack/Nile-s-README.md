# Nile Jackson README.md

## Introduction
Hi, my name is Nile Jackson. I started learning javascript about a month ago, and I'm about two weeks into my journey with java; I'm new. I decided to learn programming because of my fascination with digital audio workstation plugins, I plan on building my own in due time. Before code differently, I worked primarily in juvenile detention; this wasn't fulfilling so a little over a year ago I rented a room in brooklyn New York and began an audio engineering internship at a place called Jungle studios. After two months at jungle and several odd jobs I landed my first "gig" as the sound guy at a local bar called skytown. I continued working small gigs for a few months and traveling back to delaware 3 times a week to do carpentry work with a long time friend of mine. Eventually I decided that this life style wasn't sustainable, so after another four month internship at Manhattan Beach studios, I did some research and discovered code differently.

## Likes
I enjoy cooking because I'm an eight year vegan who misses the dishes I grew up on, namely jamaican food; I spend a lot of down time in the kitchen trying to "veganize" things. Other than food, I love to read, I hated books as a kid but four/five years ago I moved to Iowa to play(school) football at a small private college called William Penn, I wasn't a fan of Iowa or the school so I began using the library as a place to escape. I also like my two dogs, Pico(a pitbull/great dane mix) & LuLu(a small mut of some sort).
## Dislikes
I'm not a fan of the following; artichokes, english breakfast tea, the new york subway system, and excessively cold winters. 

## Hobbies
Some of my hobbies include;
* Various forms of exercise (force of habit from a life of sport)
* reading ( right now I'm reading a book called cosmos and psyche by richard tarnas)
* anime/manga (fav anime: berserk, fav manga: sakamoto days)
* lounging/napping with my dogs pico and lulu

My working/learning style: Myers briggs says I'm an INTP. It usually takes me some time to open up to new people; peers/coworkers, but after that I'm pretty much an open book. I'm a visual learner who values repition. Professionally, I'm not sure what my style is, but I'm working on that.  

My circadian rhythm: I'm a night owl, but I'd like to change that, as most of my nights tend to spill into days. This is also a work in progress. 

Why I value programming: I'm sure this will change over time, but for now I'll say I value programming because it's empowering; I went to middle/high school for fine art because I loved making "something from nothing", and the idea of making a program stirs up that same feeling. 

Moving forward: I look forward to learning github, git, and docker because I don't enjoy feeling confused. I also hope I can make myself an asset to the other members of my cohort because that would mean that I have a clue as to what's going on. My main goal here at code differently is to gain programming skills, get better at problem solving, build relationships, and get a job so I can get paid to learn.
